GPS_Receiver
============

FEI-Compliant serial GPS Receiver for REDHAWK.  It has been tested against the USB-attached BU-353S4 GPS receiver that was used on the APG RasPi "RasHawk" project.  This device is an updated and more stable version of that earlier device making this version compatible with REDHAWK 1.10 and FEI 2.0.

## Setup

Give the user that will run this Device access to whatever group owns `/dev/tty????`.  The default in CentOS 6.5 for example is `dailout` and the device shows on `/dev/ttyUSB0`:

    crw-rw----. 1 root dialout 188, 0 Oct  8 07:38 /dev/ttyUSB0

Therefore `dialout` to your user:

    usermod -a -G dialout my_user

It will likely be necessary to log out and back in again for the group changes to take effect.

## Installation

The Device requires the NMEA library found in `./nmea`.  This is the standard NMEA library with a `Makefile` generated by Eclipse.  See the `./nmea/README.md` for installation instructions.

To install the REDHAWK Device, rebuild as appropriate/typical:

    cd ./cpp
    ./reconf; ./configure; make; make install
    
**NOTE:** You will need write access to `SDRROOT` for the installation to succeed.

## Usage

Configure the `serial_port` property to set the path for the serial interface.   The device will only `start` if it can access that port.  See [Setup](#Setup) if you receive an error about being unable to access an interface that exists in the file system.
